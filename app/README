README - 
This file will document some notes on design decisions, features of the application code of toobo.

File suffixes and meanings - 
_u - utility file.
_p - contains code for a process.
_d - contains code for a daemon.

Logging - 
Initially, each process logs its debug messages to a named pipe.
There is a script that would redirect the messages written to these named pipes to appropriate files on disk.
In the future, during debug mode, a 'log interleaver' process would listen to all the named pipes (used for logging) and interleave the output into a single log file.
