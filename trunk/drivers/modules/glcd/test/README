To run this application, you need to insmod the glcd driver module into the kernel first.
Currently, there is no script which will automatically help you figure out the MAJOR number of the character driver.

Use
	cat /proc/devices to see what the MAJOR number for the glcd char driver is.

Using this MAJOR number, create a device node in /dev

      mknod /dev/glcd0 c [MAJOR_NUM] 0

Once the above has been done, you can try invoking this application to see if any graphics is displayed on the LCD.

Modify the toobo_base.h file (image data) with a b/w 128x64 pixel wide image to display the image of your choice.
Currently, there is no command line script provided to convert a given image to the required format. Use the information 
provided in toobo_base.h to create the necessary bitmap file to be included as a header file.
