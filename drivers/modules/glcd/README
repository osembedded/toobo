This folder contains driver module for a black and white Graphic LCD module with dimensions 128x64 pixels. This was tested with a module that was purchased from sparkfun.com and the LCD module name is GDM12864H.

The LCD connection is very straight forward.

Connect the power and ground pins as required.
Connect the 8 data pins to the TS7250 LCD port (PORTA - EGPIO 0-7)
Connect the CS1 pin to EGPIO15 or PORTB:7
Connect the CS2 pin to EGPIO14 or PORTB:6
Connect the rest of the pins appropriately.
It is not necessary to connect the backlight pins if no backlight is needed.

Currently, this driver module was written for Kernel version 2.4 and it does not support pin configuration at insmod time.
This feature will be added in the future.
